## Source Code Reference

Source code for dependencies is cached at `~/.opensrc/`.

Use `opensrc path` inside other commands to read source:

\`\`\`bash
rg "pattern" $(opensrc path <package>)
cat $(opensrc path <package>)/path/to/file
\`\`\`

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues (nbbaier/gent); external PRs are not treated as a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default label vocabulary (needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix) is installed in GitHub Issues. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
